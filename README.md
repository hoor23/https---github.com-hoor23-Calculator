## My process

### Built with

- **HTML**: Structuring the calculator layout.
- **CSS**: Styling the calculator, including animations and theme switching.
- **JavaScript**: Implementing calculator functionalities and theme toggling.

### What I learned

- **CSS Variables**: Used to create dynamic themes that can be easily changed using JavaScript.
- **JavaScript Event Handling**: Captured button clicks, handled input display, and calculated operations.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the layout is adaptable to various screen sizes, from small mobile devices to desktops.

### Continued development

- **Scientific Calculator**: Plan to add more advanced operations like square roots, exponents, etc.
- **History Feature**: Add a feature to show the history of past calculations.
- **Improved User Experience**: Enhance button animations and user feedback for better interaction.
